				<h1>About Minecraft</h1>
				<p>The game Minecraft was first released in November 2011. In the game, players explore a generated world
					of block materials. Players can make use of these materials to build tools, items, structures, or
					whatever they can imagine.</p>
				<p>Within the game, there are no defined rules or objectives that players have to follow. One feature
				the game offers is creative mode, which allows the player to create with infinite resources. Additionally,
				there is also a survival mode where players will need to discover and extract resources in the world in
				order to use the materials. </p>
