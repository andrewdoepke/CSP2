            <h1><u>How We Met the Project Expectations:</u></h1>
            <p>When designing this website, we had the Minecraft community in mind to bring content about new features
            in the game, an introduction to what Minecraft is for those that are new to the community, information on
            how to get the game for which type of device you will play on, a way for users to connect with the blog
            posts, post world seed information that others may find useful, and inspire new builds that users may
            enjoy.</p>
            <p>On each webpage, we included a header banner to describe what webpage you are currently on. Making up
            our whole website, we have a total of 12 webpages with different purposes. The 404.html webpage is to display
            to the user that the page they are trying to reach is unavailable/not found, the homepage is what the user
            first opens up to as an introduction to the site, the Get Minecraft page directs users towards the right
            direction on where they can download the game, and the admin login page allows an admin user to delete
            some content for the blog posts and world seed posts. Additionally, we have hub pages to contain the
            different posts users create for the blog posts or world seed posts. On these hub pages, there is a button
            that directs the user to a webpage that contains a form to create the new post, and once the post is
            submitted, there is a new webpage created containing the blog post or world seed post. Throughout our website
            there is a navigation bar listing the main webpages that users can visit. In those different webpages, there
            are different navigation links that direct the user to the intended webpage they wish to visit.</p>
            <p>Throughout our website, we implemented CSS media queries to alter the display for small and large displays
            by taking content that is aligned in rows to then arrange the content in column format (homepage and get
            minecraft primarily use this). Additionally, in the build ideas webpage, we have the displayed cards wrap
            to the next row as the width of the display decreases.</p>
            <p>Across the website, we implemented a template.html file to reduce redundancy for common features in all
            webpages that includes a global style css file primarily to style the theme of the website and some key features.
            For individual webpages, there is a local css block that links the style sheet for that webpage. Additionally,
            for each image displayed in our website, there is unique alternate text that displays describing the image
            if it is unavailable for the user. Also included in our template.html file is the favicon for each webpage
            the user visits. We used our global style sheet and the template.html to allow a coherent style implementing
            two or more different font faces displaying the text but also to align content neatly.</p>
            <p>When creating the website, we organized our non-HTML resources in the main static directory with sub-
            directories named css, images, and js for the corresponding file type.</p>

            <p>In our HTML and CSS files, we used a validator to assure there were no errors or warnings. As a result,
            we found neither. When validating the HTML, we copied the source from the browser after the flask server
            rendered everything. When naming our files, we kept the file name entirely alphanumeric with hyphens or
            underscores.</p>
            <p>I previously discussed briefly some of the content in our webpages, but we implemented the use of forms
            to create a new blog post or new world seed post, comment under a individual blog post, submit an idea for
            a new build idea, like/dislike the individual builds on the card, and login with user credentials. Some of
            these forms will then send the information either to the database or in the case of the build idea form page,
            the input will be sent by email so we can receive the information directly.</p>
            <p>We provided links to external sites in a new tab in the footer of the website by linking the official
            Minecraft social media by clicking on the corresponding image. On the get minecraft page, after selecting
            a device option, the user can click on the correct link to download the game that will open in a new tab.
            Also, in the build ideas webpage, on the back of each card, there is a link for the original YouTube creator
            walking through how to make the build with the materials listed under the card. These cards I believe are
            an interesting animation that organizes the information on the card, a picture and description on the front
            but also the link, materials to use, and a like/dislike option on the back of the card. In order to flip
            between the front and back, you simply hover your mouse over the card you would like to learn more about.
            This animation is powered by CSS in the build-ideas_style.css file.</p>
            <p>Overall, we believe we used meaningful id and class names in our code and kept a consistent layout that is
            readable and uses conventional formatting.</p>
            <p>Finally, we implemented a login portal where there are two registered users (login credentials are at
            the top of this webpage), admin and normal user. When the user is an admin, the option to delete blog posts or
            world seed posts will display. Additionally, when a user is logged in, the navigation bar will display the
            option to then log out</p>
